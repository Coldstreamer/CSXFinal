Hotelling's $T^2$ Test is a very popular way to test the means for two multivariate hypothesis. 
We extend the the Hotelling's $T^2$ two sample test to situations where the two distributions have the same form 
but the normal-distribution assumptions do no hold and the covaraiance matrix of two distributions are not identical, 
and we obtain the asympototic distributions of adjusted $T^2$ statistics.
We use simulated data first to examin our theory and we apply our method in the US-2016 election data.
