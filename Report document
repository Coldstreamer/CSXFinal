Hotelling's $T^2$ Test is a very popular way to test the means for two multivariate hypothesis. Nel and Van der Merwe Test
is an extention of two sample Hotelling's test where the covaraiance matrix of two distributions are not necessarily identical.
However, Nel and Van der Merwe Test still requires that the normal-disribution assumptions still hold. 
We further extend the Nel and Van der Merwe two test to situations where the two distributions have the same form 
but not normal. We obtain the asympototic distributions of adjusted Nel and Van der Merwe statistic using central limit theorem.
and we use simulated data first to examin our theory and we apply our method in the US-2016 election data.
